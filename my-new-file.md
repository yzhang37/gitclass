## Useful Norms

A general class of norms are called **ℓp**  norms, where $p≥1$.

$$
\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_p = \left(\sum_{i=1}^d |x_i|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$


Notice that we use this notation for the p-norm of a vector x:

$$
\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_p
 
$$


The corresponding distance that an ℓp norm defines is called the *Minkowski distance.* 

The $p$for minkowski distance means: the bigger, the norms will be less sensitive to large numbers.
